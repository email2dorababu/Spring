While working with the DB using plain old JDBC, it becomes cumbersome to write unnecessary code to handle exceptions, 
opening and closing database connections etc.
Spring JDBC Framework takes care of all the low level details starting from 
opening the connection, 
prepare and execute the SQL statement, 
process exceptions, 
handle transactions and finally 
close the connection.

so All we have to do is just define connection parameters and specify the SQL statement to be executed and do the required
work for each iteration while fetching data from the database.

Note: Spring JDBC provides several approaches and correspondingly different classes to interact with database.
Here we learn the most popular approach which makes use of JDBC Template class of the framework.

This is the central framework class that manages all the database communication and exception handling.

JDBCTemplate Class:
-------------------------
The JDBCTemplate class executes 
SQL queries, 
update statements and 
stored procedure calls,
Performs iteration over resultsets and 
extraction of returned parameter values.

It also caches JDBC exceptions and translates them to the generic, more informative, exception hierarchy defined in the 
org.springframework.dao package.
