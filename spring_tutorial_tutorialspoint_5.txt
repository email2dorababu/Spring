Spring Annotation Based Configuration:

Starting from Spring 2.5 it became possible to configure the DI using Annotations.
So instead of using XML to describe a bean wiring, you can move the bean configuration into the "component" class itself,
using annotations on the relecant class, method, or field declaration.

NOTE: Annotation injection is performed before XML injection, thus the latter configuration will override the former for
properties wired through both approaches.

Annotation wiring is not turned on in spring container by default.
So we need to enable it in our spring configuration file for annotation based wiring.

use the below line as the first line inside the <beans> tag.
 
 <beans xmlns=.....      ...>
   <context:annotation-config/>
  </beans>
